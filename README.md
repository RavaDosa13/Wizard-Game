This is my first project with python. I'm still making the second level of the game. 
I plan to do more projects in future (not just recreational) with java which I'm currently learning :)

Over the last summer I also coded many logistic regression curves which measured the rate of coronary heart disease incidence in the US based on multiple paramters
(cholesterol, BMI, weight, etc.)
